# "Ethical Maths", Buffon 1777
"Essai d'arithm√©tique morale" published in 177 by Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon, describes (and solves) an interesting problem [1](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Strick/Buffon.pdf). The problem is quite simple: drop a needle (or match, or small branch) onto a wooden floor (or other floor with parallel lines). What is the chance that the dropped item will cross a line on the floor?

Fig. 1. above describes the problem. Grey lines are needles dropped but don't cross a boundary, and blue lines cross boundaries. The needles are all of length $L$, gaps between boards of size $D$. A dropped needle has uniform angle orientation $\theta$ and uniform random position $(p_1, p_2)$.

# How do we calculate the probability of crossing?
From statistical mechanics, we know to estimate probability by counting micro- and macro-states. In this context, a micro state is a combination of angle, and position (only y position though! x-position doesn't matter), while macro-states are the total area of the "phase-space" - full swing of angles multiplied by the full gamut of positions. I've said area, but that's not really right - we're not measuring a $\rm length^2$ here, but it is a 2 dimensional measure of this space. I think the proper term would be a [Lebesque measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_measure).

Fig. 2. above shows the space we're working with. Positions of a needle are along the x-axis, and the angle of the needle along the y-axis. We need to find the positions on this plot (combinations of position and angle) which result in a cross, and ones which result in a needle not crossing a border.

Let's start thinking about this. If the angle is $0$ rad (the needle parallel to the borders), when will the needle cross a border? Well, assuming the needle has negligible width, it won't. Therefore the maximum position a needle can have with an angle $0$ rad is $D$.

What if the angle is $\frac{\pi}{2}$ rad? Then the needle is perpendicular to the border. The needle will cross the border at a position $L$ from the border (position $D-L$ on Fig. 1), only if the distance between borders $D$ is greater than $L$ (or $L \leq D$). If this is not the case then the needle will always cross the border if perpendicular. So we diverge into two cases...

## Case where $L \leq D$

What if the needle is between $\frac{\pi}{2}$ rad and $0$ rad? Now it will cross the border if needle is position a distance from the border equal to the the y-extent of the needle. To calculate the y-extent, let's look back at Fig. 1. We just need to use trigonometry to calculate the height of the right-angled triangle made with the needle and the x-axis:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:y}
y = L\sin{\theta}
\end{equation}

This function gives us the minimum distance from a border a needle must be placed in order to *not* cross it. (Or, the maximum distance from a border a needle can go in order to still cross it.)

How to we get probability from this? Well, as I mentioned earlier, we need to count our states: we need to measure the area on Fig. 3. where a needle will cross a wall. This is simply given by the integral of Equation \eqref{eqn:y} above:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:area-of-cross}
A_{cross} = \int_0^{\pi/2}L\sin{(\theta)}d\theta = L
\end{equation}

The total area is just the area of our rectangular phase space:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:total-area}
A_{total} = \frac{\pi}{2}D
\end{equation}

The probability of the dropped needle crossing a border is just the ratio of these areas:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:p}
P_{cross} = \frac{A_{cross}}{A_{total}} = \frac{2L}{\pi D}
\end{equation}

And that's our solution for the case where border separation is greater than the needle length.

## Case where $L > D$
Let's think about this perpendicularly...

If we're at a position $0$ from the border (i.e. position $D$ on Fig. 1), what is our minimum angle $\theta$ we can go without crossing the border? The needle could only be parallel to the border in this instance, $\theta=0$ radians.

Then, to the other extreme: If we're $D$ units away from the border (i.e. position $0$ on Fig. 1), what angle can we make without crossing? We're again limited by the y-extent given by Equation \eqref{eqn:y}, except we know that it crosses the y-axis as $L > D$: there must be some angle above which the needle always crosses the border. This is drawn out on Fig. 4 below:

How do we get the area now? We have two options. We could integrate the same equation as before, but with different limits for $\theta$ of $0$ and $\theta_c$, and then adding on the area $D\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta_c\right)$ (piecewise integral under the curve). Or, we could integrate with respect to position $y$ instead. We'd need to invert Equation \eqref{eqn:y} first:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:yinv}
\theta = \sin^{-1}{\left(\frac{y}{L}\right)}
\end{equation}

And then integrate between $0$ and $D$ for the area where the needle doesn't cross:
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:case-b-area-no-cross}
A_{no\ cross} &= \int_0^D\sin^{-1}{\left(\frac{y}{L}\right)}dy\nonumber \\\\\\
&= \left[\frac{y}{L}\sin^{-1}\frac{y}{L} + \sqrt{1 - {\left(\frac{y}{L}\right)}^2}\right]_0^D\nonumber\\\\\\
&= \frac{D}{L}\sin^{-1}\frac{D}{L} + \sqrt{1 - {\left(\frac{D}{L}\right)}^2} - 1
\end{align}

Hmm, not quite as elegant as the solution for the previous case.
