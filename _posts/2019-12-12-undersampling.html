title: "Undersampling: recovering high frequencies from an aliased sample."
tag: WIP
excerpt: Signal processing features prominently in my PhD project, and one issue I'm facing is how to recover an a signal given an aliased (undersampled) measurement.

<p>
My project involves building laboratory equipment and using signal processing
techniques to make sense of the measurements in a useful manner. One problem
is that the data I want to measure is noisy. Another is that the signal I want
to measure is high frequency. The nail in the coffin: my equipment is limited
in what it can measure. This results in some lovely aliasing in my data.
</p>

<p>
I want to tease more information out of my data and I hear tell of some
magical technique apparently just called "Undersampling" wherein the high
frequencies unable to be recovered by sampling can be reconstructed resulting
in an approximation of the analogue signal.
</p>

<p>
Upon first reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undersampling">Wikipedia (Undersampling)</a> article on undersampling, I was suitably
confused. It's quite a dense article. So I searched about a wee bit and found
a couple good articles and then I stumbled upon a great <a href="https://www.eetimes.com/how-to-use-undersampling/#">article</a> in EE Times. I
think the figures did it for me, a really great intuitive explanation for what
an undersampled signal looks like, and how this can be used to recover the
original.

When I started searching about for information on undersampling as a signal
processing technique, I found a whole lot of information on undersampling - a
machine learning and data science technique for rebalancing datasets. <b>The
topic of this post has nothing to do with <i>that</i> type of undersampling.</b>

A signal is undersampled if the frequency with which it is sampled is less
than twice the highest frequency in the signal. This is for <b>baseband</b>
signals: signals which have a lowest frequency of 0, therefore the <b>bandwidth</b>
becomes the same as the highest frequency.
</p>

<p>
Looking at an example of an aliased signal, timeseries of different samplings
on top, with Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on bottom:
</p>

<center><img src="/_images/fig_aliasing.png" /></center>

<p>
The signal is composed of three sine waves added together: 2Hz, 10Hz, and
50Hz. I haven't gone so far as to modulate the power of each of the signals,
which I really should for completeness, but the general solution should still
be valid.
</p>

<p>
The DFTs of the sampled signals show what frequencies are constituent in the
signals. The green DFT has peaks at each of the three frequencies, as we
expect for a signal sampled at a crazy high rate. The blue signal is sampled
at 1Hz, one fourth than that required to capture the slowest parts of the
signal and so it shows nothing - <b>where did everything go?</b> Finally, we have the
orange signal, sampled at 10Hz. This is fast enough to capture the slow
frequency, but nothing above. However, we still see two peaks in this trace,
the lower of the two corresponds to no frequency in the original signal. <b>Where
did it come from?</b>
</p>

<p>
We have these two questions to answer: why is the lowest rate signal so empty?
and what is the source of the low frequency peak in the middling rate signal?
</p>

<p>
There are three versions of the signal: the "real" signal, sampled at an
incredibly high rate soas to appear the same as the analogue version, the
"fast" version, sampled at a rate high enough to capture some, but not all, of
the signal, and a "slow" version sampled too slowly for any of the constituent
frequencies to show up.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org408e8b6">
<p>
Imagine the frequency axis of the DFT split into segments of length \(\omega_{nyq} =
  \frac{1}{2}FS\), where \(FS\) is the sampling rate. If there are parts of the
signal in segments higher than \(\omega_{nyq}\), these are "folded" down, like a leaflet
or concertina, into the lower frequencies (see the linked EE Times
article). Odd numbered segments (where counting starts at zero) are reversed
and translated to the sampling window, and even numbers are just translated to
the sampling window. The DFT then shows the sum of all these superimposed
parts of the signal. This is where the low frequency bump in the middle rate
signal comes from: the higher frequency is folded down resulting in a
peak. Another question comes to mind; <b>why is the peak lower?</b>

<p>
Going back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density">Wikipedia (Spectral density)</a> for a second, let's look at the
energy of the signal at high frequencies vs low frequencies.
</p>

<p>
\[S(f) = \left|\hat{x}(f)\right|^2\]
</p>

<p>
I have a feeling that smushing a high frequency signal down into lower
frequencies results in a lower energy response at the new smushed frequency:
perhaps this is why the peak is small in the mid rate plot.

<p>
Now we have a model in our head about how undersampling affects the resulting
signal. We can think about undoing this effect to recover something like the
original signal. Let's look at a dataseries I've collected:
</p>

<center><img src="/_images/blog_aliasing.png" /></center>

<p>
The experiment involves shearing a fluid in a Couette cell, the specifics
aren't important here, other than the fact that something is <i>rotating</i> with a
<i>rate</i> (frequency). Measurement of speed is made by a pair of optical
encoders, and stress measurement by loadcell. The expected spectrum contains a
peak at rotation frequency (marked by dashed vertical line), and perhaps a
peak at 50Hz for AC power supply. Other than those two, there should be
nothing but what the fluid creates. This fluid is glycerol, which is
sufficiently boring so nothing complex should happen when shearing it.
</p>

<p>
The signal is sampled here at around \(80\rm Hz\). This should be sufficient to
record all aspects of a signal where we expect the fastest signal to be
~\(10\rm Hz\), however with a possible signal at \(50\rm Hz\) we may not see
everything! However, we see nothing at \(50\rm Hz\). There are two peaks
reflected forwards and back with period \(5 \rm Hz\) (a <i>period</i> of \(\rm Hz\) - that's
weird to say!).
</p>

<p>
I need to have a wee think about what this means&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The mechanical instability in the apparatus contributes a "wobble" to the
results. I had taken this to present with a frequency of the rotation rate,
however perhaps the timescale is more like on the glycerol's relaxation time
(on the order of \(50 \rm ms\), or \(200 \rm Hz\)). This would be a signa entirely
to quick to read and it would get smushed back - perhaps resulting in these
reflections.
