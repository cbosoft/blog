<p>
Genetic Algorithms are a method of optimizing a function by a process similar
to that of evolution. In nature creatures have genes which effect traits which
then cause them to be successfull organisms, or not. The successful organisms
survive, and their genes are passed on. Similarly, we can generate a
<i>population</i> of solutions to a problem, decide which are successful (which of
them are <i>fit</i>) and then combine the successful solutions into a second
<i>generation</i>.
</p>

<p>
I'm interested in using a Lisp to perform function fitting: an unknown
function is performed on an input dataseries \(x\), resulting in \(y\). The
function could be recovered by trying different functions \(f(x)\) until the
results match. In Lisp, functions are data and this problem becomes just
correctly building up a list out of building blocks (operations).
</p>

<p>
So in the interest of shoe-horning anything ML into a project, I'm gonna use a
genetic algorithm to perform this function fitting.

<p>
Some definitions:

subtract, multiply, divide, integrate, differentiate)</dd>
<dt>Organism</dt><dd><code>-&gt;</code> Collection of genes together (a function)</dd>

</dl>

<p>
Let's start with a sketch of the process:
</p>
<center>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}img/ga_sketch.svg"/>
</center>

<p>
We have a bunch of genes (different genes represented by different colours
here), which can combine together into an organism, and a bunch of organisms
together forms a population. The population is assessed according to their
fitness, and the most fit organisms are allowed to reproduce. The next
generation is therefore more fit. The process is repeated until the population
is at maximum fitness (i.e. the search has converged on a solution).
</p>

<p>
The general algorithm is:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>START</b>: start with an initial population of a variety of organisms.</li>
<li><b>FITNESS</b>: assess fitness of population.</li>
<li><b>SELECTION</b>: pair up successful members of population for reproduction.</li>
<li><b>REPRODUCTION</b>: combine pairs to give offspring (the new generation).</li>
<li><b>MUTATION</b>: mutate offspring.</li>
<li><b>REPEAT</b>: <code>GOTO 2</code></li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-org96f608d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org96f608d">General Problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org96f608d">
<p>
Suppose we have a function \(f(x)\) that we can measure. We have a sample of
output \(y\), and the respective input \(x\). We want to know the form of
\(f(x)\). Functional form is often know for problems like this: so the problem
reduces to finding the correct set of coefficients and we can employ methods
like linear regression and stochastic optimisation to solve them. However, if
the function is unknown, then the problem remains complex. We could guess the
form and update our guess based upon the result and iterate until we get a
<i>good enough</i> result.
</p>

<p>
This is okay if the functional form is easy enough to guess, but what if the
function is difficult to discern? A neural network can be used to observe
patterns, but the mysterious meaning of the resulting weights of the
perceptrons may not mean anything to the reader. We can employ a similar
mechanism to a neural network, except instead of changing the weights of
combining perceptrons/neurons, we're changing the form of the pattern
function.
</p>

<p>
Using the genetic algorithm gives us a good way to decide how to perform the
update ("these functions performed well, let's keep them and work on it from
there.").

<p>
GA in the context of the function solver:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>START</b>: generate a <i>large</i> set of functions of <i>random</i> operations.</li>
<li><b>FITNESS</b>: find the most successful functions (which ones have the
smallest residual error).</li>
<li><b>SELECTION</b>: pair up successful functions, taking the top n% of organisms.</li>
<li><b>REPRODUCTION</b>: common operations in successful functions are taken into
offspring along with a random subset of the uncommon operations.</li>
<li><b>MUTATION</b>: there will be some (low, non-zero) chance for each offspring
to mutate, and each gene will have a mutation chance associated. If
mutation of a gene is selected, the operation is changed in some way
including the selected mutation.</li>

<div id="outline-container-orgc27e76b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc27e76b">Fitness</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc27e76b">
<p>
Let's start with something a bit tangible: fitness. We need to decide on a
good method for judging the fitness of an "organism". In the context of the
symbolic function fitter, this fitness is how well the function recreates the
expected output &#x2013; simply an error function. Let \(y(x)\) be our function,
\(y_{expected}\) is out expected result given the input series \(x\), and \(y_{model}\)
is the result given by our model function (the "organism") the error could be
defined simply as:
</p>

<p>
\[ \varepsilon = y_{expected} - y_{model}\]
</p>

<p>
or we can weight it against the expectation, and square it so large errors
are punished:
</p>

<p>
\[ \varepsilon = {\left(\frac{y_{expected} - y_{model}}{y_{expected}}\right)}^2\]
</p>

<p>
Either way we end up with a measure of how well the function recreates the
expectation &#x2013; the <i>fitness</i> of our organism.
</p>

<h3 id="org4c81b90">Selection</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4c81b90">
<p>
Now that we have an idea of good/bad organisms, we can decide which ones to
take forward into the next generation. This is a very important step. We want
to take enough genes forward that we have sufficient diversity to create the
solution, but we don't want to just take everything forward or we won't
converge. This step is sometimes also called "Elitism" - only the best move
forward.
</p>

<p>
We need to decide on a cut off on who to move forward. I reckon \(10\%\) is a
good number, and I've seen others use this amount, and it can always be tuned
later. So the top \(10\%\) of the population will move up to the next level.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcc5698e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgcc5698e">Reproduction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcc5698e">
<p>
Organisms selected for reproduction can now transfer their genes and create
the next generation. We can pair of the organisms and create offspring from
the pairs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>What happens to the old generation?</b> 
</p>

<p>
If the old generation are cleared after reproduction, we lose a lot of
genetic information, and the population will rapidly die unless the organisms
are allowed to produce multiple offspring.
</p>

<p>
If the old generation persist and reproduction adds new organisms every time,
the population rapidly grows and convergence is never met. Let's call this <b>rising
population reproduction</b>.
</p>

<p>
We could clear a small amount of the old generation (small, but larger than
the added amount from reproduction). Thus we have a slowly declining
population which will end in convergence, but not until sufficient
generations have passed to allow a good solution to be found. Let's call this
<b>falling population reproduction</b>
</p>

<p>
Finally, we could ensure reproduction and death are matched. The top \(10\%\)
reproduce to form an additional \(10\%\), which is matched by the bottom \(10\%\)
dying off. This will ensure the population will slowly improve towards a
soltuion, which can be improved by increasing the number of generations. This
method we'll call <b>constant population reproduction</b>.
</p>

<p>
A reproduction will take two organisms to produce an offspring. We can take
the common parts of the organisms and put them directly into the offspring,
and randomly choose from the individual (non-common) genes.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga8ce32e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga8ce32e">Mutation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga8ce32e">
<p>
Again, there are many different ways we can take this. Individual genes can
mutate, depending on their form (<code>add-coefficient</code> could be mutated by
changing <code>coefficient</code>) or new genes could be added, old genes
removed. That's three possibilities. Each reproduction will have the
possibility of one of these happening
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3f7e971" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3f7e971">Initial population</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3f7e971">
<p>
Finally, let's talk about the start. We need to start (innoculate) our petri
dish with enough genetic diversity to ensure convergence on a good solution
(especially if falling population reproduction is used). If a constant or
rising population is maintained, we can still get a good answer so long as
the population is allowed to mutate.
</p>

<p>
The population <i>complexity</i> (how many genes to an organism) should start high
enough to encapture the solution, but no to high so as to overshoot the
solution. Perhaps it would be best to start at minimal complexity (only four
or five genes) and turn up the gene mutation probability.
