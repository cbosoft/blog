<h2 id="org95495e8">Motivation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org95495e8">
<p>
I start every post with a motivation section, and normally have something a
bit useful to say. For this post, I have no "useful" motivation: I think event
driven dynamics sounds interesting, and I want to give it a go. I think I
could shoe-horn it into my research, but not to any great need.
</p>

<p>
Traditionally, simulation of hard sphere particles is achieved by integrating
a set of equations of motion, using some fancy method. This involves a (small)
finite timestep. This can result in particles intersecting (slighlty) which is
physically unrealisable and makes the simulation useless. To get around this,
the "hard sphere" property of the particles is weakened to a "sort of hard
sphere" by use of a potential - an equation which gives the force (derivative
of the <b>potential</b> energy) experienced by a particle in response to another.
</p>

<p>
A common potential is the Lennard-Jones 6-12 potential:
</p>

<p>
\[ V_{LJ} = 4\varepsilon\left[{\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)}^{12} - {\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)}^{6}\right] \]
</p>

<p>
This potential does a good job: it rapidly increases as \(r_{sep} \to
  r_{radius}\), giving a continuous function describing the radius of a particle
compatible with the finite step. However, I've implemented this in an MD sim
(well, my supervisor did) and it still dies when particles intersect. Instead
of just being insensible, the force on the intersecting particles becomes huge
and the whole sim starts becoming very excited. This is better as it gives an
indication of something being wrong, but there is still something wrong.
</p>

<p>
Enter events. An event driven simulation calculates the time the next event
will happen, then jumps to that point. The tricky part is then in sorting the
events efficiently. The hard sphere property is maintained in this kind of
simualtion, which makes it nice to do simulations with frictional particles as
the boundaries of the particle are well defined and it is known when particles
are in contact.
</p>

<p>
Here's where my research could get involved: I do work with suspensions. The
prevailing theory on the flow characteristics of dense suspensions of
particles involves frictional contact between the particles. I am running
experiments to attempt to collect statistics on the frictional interaction. If
I could model this, I could get a better idea of what to look for. 
</p>

<p>
In addition, I have a set of 3D printed bearings which are integral to my
experimental set up but are a source of mechanical noise in my stress/torque
readings: I would like to be able to simulate this (as a matter of curiosity)
to see if I can re-create the type of noise I see in my measurements.
</p>

<p>
Ooft, for a post claiming to not have much motivation, I've really rambled on
here!

In this post I'll run through the difficulties and major challenges I faced
while building <a href="https://github.com/cbosoft/BEARS">BEARS</a>.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc07bf95">

</center>

<p>
For this project, I'm defining an event as a collision of two previously
separate particles. Every particle has a position and a velocity. These are
both described by 3vectors:
</p>

<p>
\[ \vec{p} = \begin{bmatrix} p^x \\ p^y \\ p^z \end{bmatrix} \]
\[ \vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} v^x \\ v^y \\ v^z \end{bmatrix} \]
</p>

<p>
Confusingly, they tend to refer to position as \(\vec{r}\) in physics. I will
not, position is \(\vec{p}\). It won't collide with momentum, which I will
denote with a capital: \(\vec{P}\).
</p>

<p>
Given these four vectors, \(\vec{p}_1\), \(\vec{p}_2\), \(\vec{r}_1\), and
\(\vec{r}_2\), the challenge is to find out if they will collide, the time at
which the particles will collide and where they will be.
</p>

<p>
<b>This is surprisingly simple</b> (for plain ballistic simulation).
</p>

<p>
Collision at:
</p>

<p>
\[ \left| \vec{p}_1 - \vec{p}_2 \right| = \left| \Delta\vec{p} \right| = \frac{d_1 + d_2}{2} \]
</p>

<p>
Where \(d\) is the diameter of a particle. The magnitude of the separation
vector is given by:
</p>

<p>
\[  \left| \Delta\vec{p} \right| = \sqrt{\Delta{}p^x \times \Delta{}p^x + \Delta{}p^x \times \Delta{}p^x + \Delta{}p^x \times \Delta{}p^x} \]
</p>

<p>
And each position vector after time \(t\) is given by:
</p>

<p>
\[ \vec{p}_1^t = \vec{p}_1 + \vec{v}_1 \times t \]
</p>

<p>
Which we can sub into the above and the problem is just finding the roots of a
polynomial:
</p>

<p>
\[ \Delta\vec{v}\cdot\Delta\vec{v}t^2 + 2\Delta\vec{p}\cdot\Delta\vec{v}t + \Delta\vec{p}\cdot\Delta\vec{p} - \left(\frac{d_1 - d_2}{2}\right) = 0 \]
</p>

<p>
Solving this gives us the time of a collision. Negative discriminant results
in complex results: which means that the particles will not collide. Further,
if the magnitude of the separation vector is the same as the average diameter,
then the particles are already in contact. If the two solutions are positive,
then the smallest one is the time to collide (the other being the time to
collide and pass through to the other side). If the two solutions are
negative, then the collision will not happen (unless time starts to go
backwards!)

<h2 id="orge8986f4">Knowing when a pair of particles collide, what do they do afterward?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge8986f4">
<p>
For a ballistic simulation, we can model the particle interaction by assuming
<i>perfect elastic</i> collisions and can use the conservation of both momentum and
kinetic energy to calculate the resulting velocity vectors of the two
particles.
</p>

<p>
\[ \vec{P}_1^b + \vec{P}_2^b = \vec{P}_1^a + \vec{P}_2^a \]
\[ E_1^b + E_2^b = E_1^a + E_2^a \]
</p>

<p>
(\(^b\) denotes <i>before</i> a collision and \(^a\) denotes <i>after</i>), we can
calculate the velocity of a particle after a collision:
</p>

<p>
\[ \vec{v}_1^a = \frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\vec{v}_1^b + \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\vec{v}_2^b \]
</p>

<p>
(Thanks, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision">wikipedia</a>.)
</p>

<p>
This meets the requirements of this simple ballistic simulation. What if we go
further? What if friction is involved? What if the particles are nolonger
"perfectly hard"? What if the particles are not interacting in a vaccuum but
are suspended in a fluid? I'll cover these points in future posts as I build
up the sim from this starting point.

<div id="outline-container-org67776a4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org67776a4">Program structure</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org67776a4">
<p>
The structure of the program is fairly simple. We want to have a
"containter-ish" sim class which is the box of particles, and manages
timestepping and event detection - for now, when we get to parallelisation the
particles may be given domain over this matter! Particles will be generated
from a configuration file (the particle configuration file, not program
settings kind of configuration file), which will be in a simple ascii format
(space separated value or tab-separated value).
</p>

<p>
Particle objects contain their properties:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>position,</li>
<li>velocity,</li>
<li>orientation,</li>
<li>angular velocity,</li>
<li>mass,</li>
<li>diameter</li>
</ul>

<p>
And also decide whether they collide with another particle or not.
</p>

<p>
Particles are built on the heap, pointers to which are owned by the sim (so
that pointers can be pased about which makes things nice and fast).
</p>

<p>
Events are objects too (well, more like structures) and are returned by the
particle <code>check_will_collide</code> method. These objects contian information on
what particle is involved in the collision and when the collision will
happen. (Pointers to) these events are stored in the sim in a container object.
</p>

<p>
The <code>EventCollection</code> object manages the <code>CollisionEvent</code> objects which are
<code>push_back</code>'d on to it. Internally, events are stored as a map, with a
<code>std::pair&lt;int,int&gt;</code> of particle IDs as keys. This is a simple way to ensure
particles don't interact with each other twice. It allows old events to be
cleaned out as they are replaced. However, we need to sort the events by time
and choose the smallest one - or, rather, we just need to find the minimum (an
\(\mathcak{O}(n)\) operation). This collection becomes the owner of the event
pointers pushed on to it: it ~delete~s them on destruction and when replaced.
</p>

<p>
Trajectory output is important: we want to be able to track sim data (particle
positions, kinetic energy, &#x2026;) over time, so that we may make and test
hypotheses using the simulation. Otherwise, what's the point?
</p>

<p>
During the debug stage, we want to be able to profile the code in some
way. The main loop of the run method will need timers to see how long the
event detection and output steps take, to identify areas that can be improved
and to track how well each improvement performs.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there will be a "main" file which parses arguments, creates a sim
instance, loads the config file, and runs the simulation.

<p>
The event finding process is then:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>update event collection</li>
<li>find next event</li>
<li>apply event: update all particle positions and transfer momentum of interacting particles</li>
<li>repeat until no events left, or time has reached limit</li>

<div id="outline-container-orgebeb89a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgebeb89a">Efficiency gains</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgebeb89a">
<p>
The current process works great for small numbers of particles (near
instantly for a box of 1000 particles evaporating), but is becomes very
computationally expensive as the number increases. The search is
\(O(n^2)\). That search order could be better.
</p>

<p>
We only need to recalculate events for particles which were involved in the
previous event, or were going to interact with particles in the previous
event. 
</p>

<p>
My supervisor suggested only re-calculating particle positions when they're
involved in an event&#x2026; but we'd need to calculate position <i>anyway</i> when
deciding if a collision will take place. Perhaps there's a better way to
decide if particles interact?
</p>

<p>
We can parallelise (not really an <i>efficiency</i> gain, but a performance gain
to be sure) by chunking the list of particles and calculating next-events on
each thread.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org35b9163">
<p>
I've touched on this earlier, but the goal for this is to have a very
performant simulation package for hard spheres. That means I want to be able
to simulate upwards of a million particles in a reasonable amount of time <i>on
conventional hardware</i> (e.g. my laptop's 8 core i7). I could use 100 or so
cores of my department's mad simulation server, but that would be too easy!
</p>

<p>
Given that end goal, here are my next steps:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Particles with agency over their interaction</b>.  A particle should decide
for itself when/if it will interact: this will allow N-threads to pop
particles off a queue and calculate its event. This means each particle will</li>

I have noticed through profiling that there is not a significant speed up
when using multiple cores&#x2026; in fact, at best, it performs the same as when
run on a single thread! I think I may need, for future versions, to look more
at where the work is, and how I can split that up into threads.
