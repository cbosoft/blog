# Bevy

Bevy is a game engine (in Rust) which works on a data-driven model. `Entities`
are collections of `Components`, on which `Systems` run. I'm kinda new to this
but, simply put, components are objects representing **properties** of a *thing*
in game. Then there are systems which are run on components, e.g. a physics
system might operate on components with a `Kinematics` component. This makes it
easy to create a modular game - systems can be easily added and removed. It takes
a different way of thinking, but I can see glimpses of the power of the system.

This differs from more traditional systems like Unity's very object-oriented
`GameObject` based system (which I ripped off in my unfinished 
[game engine - bounce](https://github.com/cbosoft/bounce)). Object composition
through the components system here gives a similar power - and it clearly works
very well: Unity is extremely popular. Unity also shares another feature with Bevy,
cross-platform support.

Unity projects can be built for any of the major platforms (MacOS, Windows,
Linux, Android, iOS) and even consoles (with some additional SDK). Bevy supports
the desktop OSs well and out-of-the box, but Android and iOS suffer from a
little complication.  Bevy is a relatively young project under active
development and is rapidly evolving, so there are limited guides *out there* on
building for iOS. This post collects useful links together and provides a simple
guide for getting started with Bevy on iOS.

# Some light reading

Let's start by mildly rolling back something I said earlier: there isn't a *lot*
out there on using Bevy on iOS, but there are two great resources I've found:

 - [Medium article on building rust for iOS](https://medium.com/visly/rust-on-ios-39f799b3c1dd)
 - [Bevy GitHub isse #87](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/87)

The first is an article by the developers of a mobile app ("Visly"?) that uses
Rust, and targets both iOS and Android. They go through some of the steps for
building a project with a Rust component for iOS, how it needs to be compiled,
how the xcode project needs to be set up, and so on.

The latter is the GitHub issue discussing iOS support for Bevy (!) - very
relevant to this post! In fact, the first source I got from the issue, but I
thought it was worth pointing out as a source in its own right as it contains
most of the steps. There's little to be done that isn't explained in that medium
article.

# iOS and Bevy

## Install tools
First up, we need some tools to make things a bit easier.
[`cbindgen`](https://crates.io/crates/cbindgen) is handy for generating `c`
headers for Rust libraries (which we'll need to tell xcode what we're
exporting). We'll also need [`cargo-lipo`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-lipo),
a cargo extension providing a subcommand which builds universal iOS library.
(This is not strictly necessary, but makes life infinitely easier when working
between real and simulated devices.) These tools can be installed with:

```
cargo install cbindgen cargo-lipo
```

You can check they've been installed properly (and are available on `$PATH`) with

```
cbindgen --help
cargo lipo --help
```

## Set up project
You'll need your project to target a static lib. Edit your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[lib]
name = "your_library_name"
crate-type = ["staticlib", "rlib"]
```

I include `rlib` up there too to make it easier to run natively (for testing pruposes).
Make sure that you have the entry point to your bevy app (where you call `App::run`)
public in `lib.rs`, with both `extern "C"` and `#[no_mangle]`:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn bevy_main() {
  App::new()
    // set up and stuff
    .run();
}
```

## Build

To build the project you can either build it specifically for a known target
(i.e. if you're going to execute on a known architecture - iPhone or simulator)
or you can build a universal library and not worry about it.

```
cargo lipo --release
```

will build a universal library and place it in `target/universal/release`.

## Generate headers

It's not terribly onerous to write a header for a library, but `cbindgen` will do
it for us:

```
cbindgen <path/to/lib.rs> -l c > <path/to/header.h>
```

will create a header corresponding to the library at the given path. Check the
header to make sure what you expect to be available is indeed available.

## Set up Xcode project

Right so here's the tiresome step. You need to create a new Xcode project. I find
it handy to keep it in the same directory as the rust library, but it's up to you.

Create a new iOS app project. You can use either Swift or Objective-C, storyboard
or SwiftUI, doesn't matter. I'll be giving examples using Objective-C. We'll be
ripping most of that boilerplate out later on anyway. Name the project whatever
you want and hit "create".

With the project created, you can delete everything that isn't the main.m file.
Strip out the contents of "Info.plist" as well, anything related to the
storyboard and so on.

Next, we need to tell Xcode where to find our library and header. Let's create
directories for each in the Xcode project directory: "lib" and "include". Then
copy the generated header and built library into the relevant directory:

``` bash
# from bevy project root
mkdir -p <xcode-project-dir>/lib
mkdir -p <xcode-project-dir>/include
cp <rust.h> <xcode-project-dir>/include/.
cp target/universal/release/<lib.a> <xcode-project-dir>/lib/.
```

Add the include directory to the search path (in Xcode: project ->
Build Settings -> Search Paths -> Header Search Paths) and also add the include
directory to the search path (in Xcode: project -> Build Settings -> Search Paths
-> Library Search Paths).

Add the library to the list of frameworks (in Xcode: project -> General ->
Frameworks). You'll also need to add some frameworks:

  - UIKit.framework
  - AudioToolbox.framework
  - Metal.framework

as well as a reference to `libc++.tbd`.

Last thing before we can build the iOS app, let's sort out the `main.m` file.
Bevy will handle the creation of windows and so on, so go
ahead and edit `main.m` to use our main function:

```objective-c
#include <UIKit/UIKit.h>
#include <rust.h>

int main() {
  bevy_main();
  return 0;
}
```

If your library was called `rust.h` and your main function is called `bevy_main`.

All going well you should be able to build an iOS app and run it in the simulator!

<center>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/ios_bevy/borked_on_ios.png" style="width: 300px;"/>
</center>

# Wait, what's gone wrong?

Building and running yields a happy little simulated iPhone with the rust app
running... and only half visible. What you'd expect is something like this:

<center>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/ios_bevy/okay_on_macos.png" style="width: 300px;"/>
</center>

Why does our iOS app have a black box on the left? Why is the camera all off-target?

Well it turns out it's quite simple. Annoyingly simple ðŸ˜‘

I spent a while looking into how
bevy creates windows on iOS, the libraries involved. I looked into the settings of
the Xcode project, Info.plist and so on, to see if that was the cause. However
turns out the app just wasn't sizing itself properly and iOS doesn't allow users to
resize apps (obviously). The app can try to set a size for itself that isn't the same as
the iOS device screen, and we get the symptoms seen above. The fix is very simple:
**make the app fullscreen**.

This is easy enough to do, just need to amend the app builder function (our `bevy_main`):

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" bevy_main() {
  App::new()
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins.set(WindowPlugin {
      window: WindowDescriptor {
        mode: WindowMode::Fullscreen,
        ..default()
      },
      ..default()
    }))
    // otherwise set up app
    .run();
}
```

Now that the xcode project is set up, all we need to do in order to rebuild
is build+copy the library to the xcode project:

```bash
cargo lipo --release
cp target/universal/release/<library> <xcode-project-dir>/lib/.
```

and then build the Xcode project...

<center>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/ios_bevy/okay_on_ios.png" style="width: 300px;"/>
</center>

Ah now that's what I want to see! ðŸ˜€

# Summary of steps

 1. Install `cbindgen` (generate `C` headers): `cargo install cbindgen`
 2. Install `cargo-lipo` (build universal binaries): `cargo install cargo-lipo`
 3. Setup project (staticlib target, extern+no_mangle main func)
 3. Build using `cargo lipo --release`
 4. Generate header using `cbindgen <path/to/lib.rs> -l c > <lib.h>`
 5. Set up xcode project (trim Info.plist, remove all but `main.m`)
 6. Copy header and library to xcode project
 7. Add library as linked (in project general settings)
 8. Add header to search path, add library to search path (in build settings)
 9. Add frameworks (AudioToolbox.framework, UIKit.framework, Metal.framework)
 10. Add other libraries (libc++.tbd)
 11. Edit main.m to use the rust-implemented main function in the library.

# Re-building

To re-build the project for xcode after changes to the rust codebase, just
need to build the library, make sure the header is up to date, and copy
to the Xcode project directory:
```bash
XCODE_PROJ_DIR="<path/to/xcode/proj>"
LIBRARY="name_of_library"
LIBRARY_SRC="path/to/lib.rs"

# ensure lib and include dirs exist
mkdir -p ${XCODE_PROJ_DIR}/include
mkdir -p ${XCODE_PROJ_DIR}/lib

# create header
cbindgen ${LIBRARY_SRC} -l c > ${XCODE_PROJ_DIR}/include/${LIBRARY}.h

# build library
cargo lipo --release

# copy library
cp target/universal/release/lib${LIBRARY}.a ${XCODE_PROJ_DIR}/lib/.
```
