<h2 id="org3442d8d">A big to-do list</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3442d8d">
<p>
When I started on Áite Domhainn I had some grand ideas: a procedurally
generated universe (easy enough); a user controlled colony that grows over
time (yeah okay, can do); a realistic history for the planets (ooft, okay
maybe); multiplayer interaction (not too bad I guess, a bit of added
complexity); RPG-style statistics that represent the abilities of the colony
(more complexity)&#x2026; The list goes on.
</p>

<p>
This quickly became unweildy. The code base has grown pretty dramatically to
some 300-odd files or so. Not huge, but a fairly big codebase for one (fairly
green) person to manage. A big issue was with the generality of the code I was
writing. I wanted code to be <i>too reusable</i>. This resulted in some janky code
that wasn't super useful, readable, or (probably) safe to use. In addition,
the generality limited useability of the code; which in turn stunted the
scope. I had imagined this grand game, but it would turn out to feel
half-assed because of this.
</p>

<p>
I became disheartened, and I almost abandoned to project. Other work was
piling up and Áite was left to the side for a few weeks.
</p>

<p>
However, I didn't want to let the project fall to the wayside, I like the
concept and I want to see it through to completion: I decided Áite needed to
go on a diet!

<h2 id="org4055d9a">What to cut?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4055d9a">
<p>
I decided to be a bit brutal. I'm cutting everything that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvWs2X-bEA">"does not spark
joy"</a>, with the thinking that features can be added back later.
</p>

<p>
Colony statistics and RPG elements are cut. This will impact the progression
of the game, as the game will become predictable with no improvement; this
will be the first feature to add in next.
</p>

<p>
Projects are cut. These were activities the colony could work on (production
of a <i>thing</i>, create new habitable area, travel to new world). The blurry
scope made the projects really amorphous and tough to limit. These will have
to be re-thought and re-worked if they're to be re-added. That's a lot of
re-ing!
</p>

<p>
History elements are cut. These are pretty tough to keep consistent,
especially in the procedurally generated game. I'd rather just not have it
than have it inconsistently done.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org07fc117" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org07fc117">Okay, so what's <b>left</b>?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org07fc117">
<p>
Procedurally generated worlds, stars, nebulae etc? Check. A colony that grows
over time? Check. Detailed descriptions of the planets? Check. Technically
multiplayer? Check. CLI interface? Check.
</p>

<p>
This means leaves more of an aquarium than a game, but its a starting point!
The player's colony will grow over time and try to explore new locations when
they run out of space.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3a072dc" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3a072dc">Adding some game</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3a072dc">
<p>
How to add some game to this aquarium? That's a good question.
</p>

<p>
The game will need to establish the <b>needs</b> of a colony (space, power,
resources), and then establish a means by which the resoruces become
<b>scarce</b>. This could be due to growth (a bigger colony needs more space), or due
to player desires (adding abilities consuming resources), or due to upkeep on
requirements (habitat requiring maintenance upkeep of metal etc).
</p>

<p>
The previously implemented Projects system was too amorphous and generic. I
want the player to be able to add in new abilities to the colony, but I need
to rethink how to implement this. This will add the necessary element of
<b>strategy</b> into this strategy game.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there needs to be a failure condition. There should be some way for
the player to lose. This is necessary to create some kind of tension for the
player, some motivation. Otherwise, there is no need for the player to ever
really play the game.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5a37747" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5a37747">Needs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5a37747">
<p>
A colony will have the following needs:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Space</li>
<li>Power</li>
<li>Resource</li>
</ul>

<p>
Space, as in living space, is obtained by exploring new planets and building
new habitat in the available space. This need is exacerbated by the growth of
the colony. The colony will forever need new space.
</p>

<p>
Power is provided by solar and nuclear generation methods. Nuclear fuel is
created by processing resource and solar power to created by harnessing the
light from nearby stars. Power is required by population, and also by new
abilities.
</p>

<p>
Resources are found by exploring new planets and become scarce by use in
various ways.
</p>

<p>
This is a simplification; in game, this is more complex (space and power are
processed resources, derived from resources, which are broken down into
constituents). I'm leaving the complicated version in-server, but the client,
I think, will only talk about the simplified versions ("3x10<sup>5</sup> m3 of living
space", "5x10<sup>24</sup> kg of usable resources").
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org46abb6d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org46abb6d">Scarcity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org46abb6d">
<p>
Resources are used up as the colony grows. Whether in space (a bigger colony
needs more room) or in time (over time the colony will drain its stock of
resource).
</p>

<p>
Discussed in the next section are Abilities, things the colony works up to
being able to do. These abilities will add drains onto the Colony's resources
and contribute to the scarcity.
</p>

<h3 id="org092e9b0">Abilities</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org092e9b0">
<p>
I'd like there to be some player advancement in the game. Like in a game of
Civ: as a game goes on your cities grow and production increases and
buildings are created faster, so that when you start a new game you are
starkly reminded how far you've come. So to in Áite. I'd like the player to
feel a sense of progress over time. This will be accomplished by the use of
Abilities.
</p>

<p>
A colony can work towards abilities, requiring the use of resources and time
to obtain.

<div id="outline-container-org3f30d9f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3f30d9f">Interaction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3f30d9f">
<p>
I didn't mention it above, but I guess its implied. There will need to be a
way for the player to interact! I had envisaged a plurality of interaction
methods: a curses-based TUI, a full GUI, as well as the command line command
processor. However, I think the former two are antithetical to the original
idea: a game you "play" in your terminal over the course of many, many weeks.
</p>

<p>
I think simple commands would be the easiest way to achieve this, perhaps
being strict with having a minimal syntax:
</p>

<pre class="example">
aite_client &lt;command&gt; [&lt;subcommand&gt;]
</pre>

<p>
This would force me to keep the game (and the codebase) simple.

<h2 id="org2f69a38">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2f69a38">
<p>
So I'm gonna trim the fat on Áite: cutting features I regard as bloat. I'm
gonna keep it simple, and not introduce new (unnecessary) features. I'm going
to keep additions minimal, and only introduce them if they coincide with the
games intent: simple idle game, elements of strategy and space adventure.
