Hi I'm Chris, a researcher of things. I have (finally) completed my PhD in complex fluid rheology (Dept. of Chem. Eng., Univ. Strathclyde), and am now a research associate in the Future Manufacturing Research Hub in Continuous Manufacturing and Crystallisation (CMAC) (also based at Strathclyde).

I'm currently leveraging machine learning to improve measurement of the properties of crystals (the pharmaceutical kind, not the homeopathic kind). These techniques will be used to improve modelling and real-time control of
these crystallisation processes.

I write posts to help cement ideas in my brain - I tend to write about stuff as I learn it. I also write about stuff I've built to showcase it - highlighting issues and how they were surmounted.

I make games. Well, err, I start to and then I get distracted. Turns out games design is quite hard - harder than implementing them! I struggle through though. I've stalled two games (Sìobhaltas, née Áite Domhainn - a procedural space sim, and geas - 2d metroidvania platformer with Lovecraftian themes) so far, and am working on a game engine, which I am determined to finish this time! Check out the [games tag](/tag/games) to see examples.

Most of my posts here will centre around a project I've been working on - check them out on my [github](https://github.com/cbosoft).
