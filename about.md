Hi I'm Chris, a researcher of things. I am finishing up my PhD in complex fluid
rheology in the Department of Chemical and Process Engineering at the University
of Strathclyde and have just started a Research Assistant position with
Continuous Manufacturing and Crystallisation (CMAC) (also based at Strathclyde).
I'm currently leveraging machine learning to improve measurement of the
properties of crystals (the pharmaceutical kind, not the homeopathic kind).
These techniques will be used to improve modelling and real-time control of
these crystallisation processes.

I write posts to help cement ideas in my brain - I tend to write about stuff as
I learn it. I also write about stuff I've built to showcase it - highlighting
issues and how they were surmounted.

I make games in my spare time. It turns out game design is hard, harder even
than implementing them. Check out the [games tag](/tag/games) to see
examples.

Most of my posts here will centre around a project I've been working on - check
them out on my [github](https://github.com/cbosoft).
