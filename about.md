title: About

I'm Chris! A researcher of things, and general nerd. I am finishing up my PhD
(where I delved into the causes of some pretty cool rheological phenomena in
cornstarch suspensions) and have just started a Research Assistant position at
CMAC in the University of Strathclyde.  I'm building better ways of measuring
shape and size of crystal particles (the pharmaceutical kind, not the
homeopathic kind).

I'm interested in lots of things: machine learning, computer programming,
physics, electronics, video games (playing them), video games (designing them).

Most of my posts here will centre around a project I've been working on - check
them out on my [github](https://github.com/cbosoft).
