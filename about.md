<h1>Hi!</h1>
<p>I'm Chris, a researcher and coder. I am currently a research associate in the Future Manufacturing Research Hub in Continuous Manufacturing and Crystallisation (CMAC) applying deep learning to image analysis, and building software to support that. Including in-house annotation web apps and databases for managing training.</p>

<p>Currently working on the CMAC Hub DataFactory project, bringing image analysis to our automated robotics platform.</p>

<!--<p>My time at CMAC is coming to a close (darn fixed-term contracts!) so I'm <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}cv"><b>open to work</b></a>.</p>-->

<h3>What's all this then?</h3>
<p>I write posts to help cement ideas in my brain; I tend to write about stuff as I learn it. I also write about stuff I've built to showcase it - highlighting issues and how they were surmounted. These "portfolio pieces" are gathered in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}tag/projects">project page</a>.</p>

<p>Other stuff I write about is loosely characteristed into tags - see the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}all_tags">tag page</a> for the full list.</p>
