# Completing a PhD

In March 2021 I submitted by thesis after a fraught few months getting it finalised. The stress was exacerbated by the deadline being moved *forwards by a month*. However, after many 16 hour days and little-to-no down time, I managed it. Phew. It was all over, right?

Unfortunately no, not so much.

After thesis submission came the Viva Voce (latin for living voice for some reason). This, for me, was a five hour discussion of my work and its place in the wider research world. This was something I had not made terribly clear in my thesis. I actually really enjjoyed my viva. The question and answer session I felt was a great opportunity to defend my work and to fill any gaps that were missing in the thesis. 10/10 would viva again.

After the viva came the worst part; corrections.

I'll happily admit my initial thesis draft needed improvement. Time limitations, compounded my starting a new job, meant I was almost rushing to get everything written on time. I was writing up to the last minute - I wrote my last chapter the night before I submitted (!). Time issues weren't my only problem: I had left a gap in my literature review to be filled; I had made an incorrect assumption about a calculation upon which some of my results hinged; and my thesis was riddled with typos. All this is to say, I knew I had some problems to address. Despite that, tackling corrections was one of the hardest things I have done.

# A tall order

When my corrections were sent to me roughly a month after my viva, I got to work. I read through the list of comments and proposed changes. The list was long, very long. I knew I'd need some way of keeping organised. I split the extensive to-do list into groups with each task appraised by how long I reckoned it would take to complete. Rank 1 - a minute, rank 2 - an hour, rank 3 - a day. I found this very helpful as it gave me a way of measuring my progress: how far I had come and how far I had left to go.

Once my "stock take" was complete, I could get started in earnest. I started every evening tackling some number of corrections. I read my reviewers comments, I re-read them. For the vast majority of the comments I agreed completely. Sometimes I disagreed. Sometimes I had blinkers on and thus I didn't see their point. I'd be halfway through writing a rebuttal until, after reading their comment for the fifth time, I saw the full impact and I realised that no, I was in the wrong.

For weeks and weeks every evening and most of my weekend I spent correcting my thesis. I read a comment about something I had done wrong, I read a comment about some typo I had made. About the lack of detail or confusing explanation or missing cross reference or...

This is what I found most difficult. The corrections stage was damn *emotionally draining*.

# Was it worth it?

Absolutely.

Every nit-pick, every wording change, every little comment made me consider my thesis not as *my* thesis, but as just another thesis: a document which describes a hypothesis and its testing in a detailed, rigorous, repeatable manner. This de-personalisation of it really helped. I realised that it doesn't matter if the mistakes are made, they can be fixed. **It's not high school, after all: it's real life!**.

This epiphany of sorts gave me a resounding confidence boost. I felt more able to adequately defend my work as I was better able to see my work for what it was, and not for what I thought it was (my baby, my perfect precious thesis-baby).

In addition, after the gruelling process of correction I have had a scientific critical voice embedded into my brain. I have found this really helpful for giving feedback on written work to others, and even when reading scientific papers. I suppose this is a voice I should have developed much earlier in my PhD, but I got there eventually ðŸ™ƒ
