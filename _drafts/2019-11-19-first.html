Suppose you have a microscope image of some tissue. Some cells in the tissue are
stained so they glow a certain colour. You want to quantify these cells so you
know how many have been stained. This would be easy if the cells are sparse, you
could just could the coloured blobs. However, if the tissue is relatively intact
the cells might be in very close proximity to one another, <b>with poorly defined
borders</b>. This makes it difficult to decide which cell is which.

<p><b>Figure</b>: an example of these ill-defined cells. From: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12948-018-0084-9">doi.org/10.1186/s12948-018-0084-9</a></p>

In the above figure, there are examples of cells which have been stained. No
idea what kind of cell, where they came from, or what they're stained with; this
was the first image result I found that fit the problem parameters. Figure
sections C and E show the "smushed" effect quite nicely.

I think this could be solved using Python and OpenCV.

The image I have is a .png with 12 sections showing different densities of
cells.

Turns out, this task is pretty darn tricky. The person I was doing this for isn't all that keen on keepin on
