I have written a lisp interpreter previously and I found the experience really interesting. In doing so, I learned a lot about C++ (the language I implemented the interpreter in). Every so often I get the inclination to go back and improve the interpreter, fold in the knowledge that I've gained since. However, I had the idea of challenging myself a bit - what if I wrote a lisp compiler instead?
