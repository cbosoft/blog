In my PhD I performed in-lab investigation into the behaviour of a model system of complex fluid. In my post-doc at CMAC, I undertake computational investigations into machine learning architectures applied to image analysis tasks (amongst other things).

During my PhD, and even my undergrad, I wanted to get involved in computational work. I loved the idea of being productive while doing something else. So being able to run a simulation while writing something (or watching tv...) would have been great. Of course, the effort you are expected to put in is fairly constant so being able to multi task more easily does not translate into taking less time for work - it just translates into more work getting done!

So how different are computational scientific investigations as compared to the more traditional laboratory approach? Let us count the ways...
