# Motivation
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) seems like a great idea, but in instances where you need to input a OTP code frequently then unlocking your phone, opening the Authenticator app, and copying the code (perhaps manually, perhaps via shared clipboard) can be exceedingly tedious.

A desktop MFA Authentication app is a terrible, *terrible*, ***terrible*** idea from a security perspective. It turns what is a relatively ok second factor into a really quite poor second factor. (I'm not even sure if it still counts as a second factor - it's on the same device!) It is for this reason I have the disclaimer/banner at the top.

All that said, I thought this could be useful for accounts for which security is not a concern but for whatever reason MFA is required.

# Specification
The resulting application from this project is an implementation of the TOTP protocol ([RFC6238](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6238)) for the desktop.

The application must:
- be exceedingly easy to use (i.e. one-click to obtain OTP),
- preferably have OTP delivered straight to clipboard,
- (optionally) be able to work with multiple accounts, and
- (optionally) have a secure method of storing application data (e.g. secret keys for MFA accounts)

# Development Challenges
## TOTP Algorithm
The first real challenge was finding out about and then implementing the MFA algorithm itself. This turned out to be a relatively easy and fun task - I wrote about it [here]({% post_url 2022-06-07-impl-mfa-auth %}).
