# Motivation

My PhD project revolved around the design and construction of a novel rheometer device. Control software was required to manage the running of the hardware, and to record measurements to file. I wrote the software in Python originally, but moved to C for performance. The software was written for the control computer, a Raspberry Pi, and thus for a Linux environment.
